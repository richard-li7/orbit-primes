# Primitive Permutation Groups Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains a SageMath Jupyter Notebook that explores primitive permutation groups. The primary focus is to find a partition on the set that these groups act on, with \( p' \) stabilizers for every prime \( p \geq 5 \) that divides the order of the group.

## Features
- Identification of primitive permutation groups.
- Computation of group orders that are divisible by primes \( \geq 5 \).
- Partition of the set acted upon with specific stabilizers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- SageMath (recommended version 9.0 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/richard-li7/orbit-primes.git

2. Navigate to cloned directory
cd orbit-primes

### Usage
To run the notebook
1. Start the notebook server
   sage -n jupyter
2. Open the PrimeStabHalfSize.ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.
